*What Will Happen?*

*Rain drops will fall from the clouds created by processing.
*These raindrops will fall at intervals, one by one, or even multiple at a time.
*There will be a catcher at the bottome of the screen. To control this catcher, the player will use their mouse.
*The catcher will ONLY move in the x direction of the mouse (it has a predetermined Y value).
*Each time a raindrop hits the catcher, the score variable will increase. 
*Each time a raindrop is not catched, the player will lose a life.
*If a player loses all of her/her lives, they will lose the game.


*Algorithm*

*Create a Raindrop class
*In the class, create an array of raindrops
*create a catcher class.
*Make the catcher display and follow your mouse in the x direction.
*Check to see if the raindrops touch the catcher.
*If the raindrops come in contact with the catcher, the score variable will increase and that same raindrop will disappear.
*After a ceratin interval, another raindrop will fall.
